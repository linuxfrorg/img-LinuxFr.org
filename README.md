External images on LinuxFr.org
==============================

Our users can use images from external domains on LinuxFr.org.
This component is a reverse-proxy / cache for these images.

Th main benefits of using a proxy instead of linking directly the images are:

- **No flood**: images can be hosted on small servers that are not able to
  handle all the traffic from LinuxFr.org, so we avoid to flood them
- **History**: even if a server is taken down, we are able to keep serving
  images that are already used on our pages
- **Security**: on the HTTPS pages, we won't include images from other domains
  that are available only in HTTP, so it prevents browsers from displaying
  warning about unsafe pages
- **Privacy**: the users won't connect to the external domains, so their IP
  addresses won't be logged on these servers.

How to use it? (outside Docker)
-------------------------------

[Install Go](http://golang.org/doc/install) and don't forget to set `$GOPATH`

    $ go get -v -u github.com/linuxfrorg/img-LinuxFr.org
    $ img-LinuxFr.org [-a addr] [-r redis] [-l log] [-d dir]

And, to display the help:

    $ img-LinuxFr.org -h

How to use it? (with Docker)
-------------------------------

Build and run Docker image:

    $ docker build -t img-linuxfr.org .
    $ docker run --publish 8000:8000 img-linuxfr.org
    or
    $ docker run --publish 8000:8000 --env REDIS=someredis:6379/1 img-linuxfr.org

Why don't you use camo?
-----------------------

Github has developed a similar service, camo, for their own usage.
I used it as a source of inspiration but I prefered to redevelop a new service
instead of using it for several reasons:

- It lacks some feature and particulary caching!
- It runs with a legacy version of node.js, which is not very friendly for our
  sysadmins.
- I plan to extend it for other usages in the future, and I prefer coding in
  golang than in nodejs.
- And it's a fun component to recode :p
